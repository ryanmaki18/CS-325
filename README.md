CS 325 - Analysis of Algorithms -- Taken at Oregon State University

Hey there! Here are all of the algorithms I either looked at in lectures or coded myself when I took CS 325 - Analysis of Algorithms (from Oregon State University). Taken as an 8 week course.

Measurable Student Learning Outcomes
1. Prove the correctness of algorithms using induction.
2. Define O, Ω, and θ in a rigorous way.
3. Solve simple recurrence relations.
4. Implement a recursive algorithm to solve a simple problem.
5. Implement a divide-and-conquer algorithm to solve a problem of intermediate
difficulty.
6. Implement a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm to solve an NP-hard problem.
7. Explain how a problem is shown to be NP-complete.
8. Compute the time complexity of polynomial-time and exponential-time iterative and
   recursive algorithms.
9. Design dynamic programming algorithms and analyze their running time.
